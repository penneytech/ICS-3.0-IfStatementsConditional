/* 
You are creating an app that keeps track of how old the produce in your fridge is. You will track the age of lettus, apples, and carrots currently inside.

1) Declare a variable for the age of each type of vegetable (do not assign a value for now)

2) Create an IF statement for each type of produce that will log the message "The (vegetable) is/are bad" when the age is greater than:
    a) 8 days for lettus.
    b) 15 days for apples.
    c) 20 days for carrots.

3) Set the initial value of each variable so the messages from step 2 are triggered.
